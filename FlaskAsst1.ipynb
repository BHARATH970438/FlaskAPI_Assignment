    "1. Flask is known for its simplicity and minimalistic design. It has a small core and a modular structure, allowing developers to add only the necessary components. This simplicity makes it easy to learn and use, particularly for beginners.\n",
    "2. Flask provides great flexibility, allowing developers to make decisions about how they want to structure their applications.\n",
    "3. Flask is highly extensible and provides a wide range of extensions to add additional functionality to your application. These extensions cover various areas such as database integration, authentication, form validation, and more.\n",
    "4. Flask comes with a built-in development server, which makes it easy to develop and test applications locally. It enables rapid prototyping and simplifies the development workflow.\n",
    "5. Flask has a large and active community of developers, which means there are plenty of resources, tutorials, and libraries available."
